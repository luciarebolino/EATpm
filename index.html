    <header2>_UNPREDICTABLE ATMOSPHERE</header2>
    <header3>_01. Archiving uncertainity</header3>
   
    <p></p>
    <div>To predict future climate models, research agencies collect essential weather data by measuring the vibration of water vapor particles. Weather tracking systems can detect the atmosphere within the 24 GHz frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum, but in recent years telecommunications companies have selected the same band for 5G use, obstructing
the collection of atmospheric data.

      <br></br>
 These open bands on the spectrum become spaces of political conflict, and the critical proximity between the two systems generates new forms of interference. This contested multidimensional space becomes a new ground for experimentation to be watched through the lens of computation.
    <br></br>
    Iâ€™m interested in investigating the concept of Archiving the climate as a contemporary practice, and visualize this layer of gathering information between dimensions, human and non-human.
As a contemporary designer, I would like to place myself in a space of uncertainty that
characterise our time, and specifically how to represent the unknown, the invisible space of
the relation that exists between human and the atmosphere, in the new climatic regime.

    <br></br>
Taking notes from James Bridle's book, New Dark Ages, I found this extract that
describes this concept of uncertainty
We connect to the cloud; we work in it; we store and retrieve stuff from it; we think it through. We pay for it and only notice it when it breaks.
Uncertainty, mathematically and scientifically understood, is not the same as
unknowing. Uncertainty, in scientific, climatological terms, is a measure of precisely
what we do know. And as our computational systems expand, they show us ever more
clearly how much we do not know.

 <br></br>
The cloud is the metaphor for contemporary technology where everything and
everyone is connected but is also a visible mass of condensed water vapour floating in
the atmosphere.
To predict the uncertain future in which we are projected we need to visualise the new
forms of the climate.

    <br></br>
   Atmosphere, an uncertain archive for unpredictable future

    I learned how to draw attention to abstract issues far from public discussion, to rotate the size and visibility of topics distant from the human lens.
    <br></br>
Much of the initial time was spent studying the actual problem, the debate, the contemporary conflict that led to the decision of materialization through artistic intervention. 
The second phase was to define what medium was best suited to bring the discussion to a public audience, and to materialize an abstract, political concept into something calculable and dimensional.
If I had more time, I would have liked to focus more on understanding the technical mechanisms to connect the whole human-machine experience, within a larger interaction space, without recourse to simulations.
<br></br>
The feedback I received was to think about an experience made up of multiple levels of interaction, multiple elements. I find it interesting and challenging to think about how the level of complexity and opacity of this specific theme can be visualized within multiple lenses in the same space. Connected or disconnected, I imagine a space in which multiple things happen simultaneously, a narrative made up of different degrees.
Research and experimentation happened on the same stage, the idea of addressing this specific theme comes from a personal interest in the research area, but the ambition to experiment is part of the interdisciplinary practice I would like to follow in my future path as an architect at the intersection of art and science.
<br></br>
I want to use future time and resources to expand the project, both creatively/technologically but also from the structure of the exhibition itself, to understand what tools and techniques are needed to engage and draw attention to specific political/social/climate issues and themes.
